# Bus Sticker
Bus sticker is a mini project to bring just-in-time bus information to riders at bus stops. 

## Problem
Bus arrival apps usually use geolocation to identify the user's current bus stop. Upon identifying bus stops in the vicinity, users often have to select the right bus stop themselves, thus increasing friction to getting the one single piece of info they need: the arrival time of their bus.

## Solution
Users can print a QR code and stick it at the bus stop of they frequently use. Subsequent usage just requires them to scan the QR to get a quick lightweight HTML page with the bus arrival times provided front and center. No ambiguity with correct bus stops.
